* Please create an issue before creating a pull request. Your changes are more likely to be pulled in after we discuss implementation, scope, etc. in an issue.

#### Checklist for your code
* Have you tested the code yourself?
* Have you [documented your functions and their parameters and return values with JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/about-getting-started.html)?
